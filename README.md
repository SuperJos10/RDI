# RDI | Roblox Deployment Installer
This tool fetches Roblox deployments and installs them locally onto your computer. This tool can come in very handy if you're trying to rollback your Roblox version or update it to the latest.
It is fully developed via python and requests to install the files in a **legal manner**.
